    <h2>Mochi Images</h2>
    <img src="./images/mochi.jpg" alt="mochi JPG">
    <p>JPG's are great for photos with lots of color without making file size
        too large but, hey dont support transparent pixels. </p>

    <img src="./images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi gif">
    <p>GIF's offer simple animation but with limited color palette. <strong>NEVER</strong> use
    them for photos.</p>

    <img src="./images/mochi.png" alt="mochi png">
    <p>PNG's are great for anything thats not a photo or animated. They
        are usually larger file size and have great colors.</p>

    <img src="./images/mochi.svg" alt="mochi svg">
    <p>SVG's are vector based and can scale to any size without loss of quality.
        Perfect for responsive design. Use them whenever you can.</p>
